To make this setup work you should create a file called `user.lua` in awesomewm config folder. This file may contain some private information and must be ignored by version control tool. Here is the file example:
```
user = {
    lock_screen_password = "change me"
}
```

#### Hotkeys:
- `super + a` - toggle sidebar
- `super + e` - show exit screen
- `super + alt + l` - show lock screen
- `PrintScreen` - take screenshot

#### Notes:
Average system load daemon contains hardcoded variable that specifies the number of CPUs. Edit `evil/sysload.lua` to make system load bar show correct information.

The script `copy-dotfiles.sh` is used for copy dotfiles into git working directory. To make this setup work on your system you should copy config files manually.
